                      The government of Chile runs a yearly program where it issues grants to 100
                      startups that have the potential to create a difference in society. We were
                      fortunate enough to get this grant as it not only allowed us to test run our
                      product in collaboration with the Chilean government but also helped us scale
                      our product to new heights.

                      innovative technologies and approaches around the world that have the
                      potential to improve vaccine delivery, which has been stuck at 80 percent for
                      several years now.
