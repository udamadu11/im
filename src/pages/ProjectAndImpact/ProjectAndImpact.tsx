                  The Coronavirus taught us a tough lesson about the importance
                  of immunization, and how it can save millions of lives and
                  billions of dollars of the governments across the globe.
                </p>
                <p className="text-left">
                  It is a known fact now that the immunization gap not only has
                  economical drawbacks, but it also destructs the living
                  standard of the society. The World Health Organisation (WHO)
                  and The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI)
                  have affirmed the importance of vaccinations several times in
                  the past, and still there are a very few technologies that can
                  help the cause of "not leaving a single child unimmunised".
                </p>
                <p className="text-left">
                  Well, ImmunifyMe is fortunate enough to have a technology that
                  can actually fill this gap of immunization and help the world
                  save about 5-6 million lives per year, leading to the
                  financial worth of $80-100 billion (as estimated by GAVI).

                  Our system completely does away the paper-based system and
                  therefore, contributes its fair share of being eco-friendly.
                  We have successfully executed some projects across the globe
                  and some of them are still underway.
